## Release 0.4

We are happy to announce a new release first time at this site!

During last weeks a lot happened, number of test files generated multiplied several times, and while this is in large part different variants of calibration patches this is still a big step for the project.
We support now pretty much every common format in widespread use today and ready to extend for new ones.

  * Quantization uniformity / local non-linearity detection:
    * 2D Quantization grid
    * 3D Quantization cross pattern (dynamic sweeps)

##### Calibration patterns

  * Full screen fills and 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% window calibration patches
